# API-Project-Agha-AliShanti

## 📍 User Story

- As a user, I want to input a github user name .

- As a user, I want to see all the repos of the user.

- As a user, I want to see the total stars of the user.

## 📍 User journy

✨ When the user opens the application, he will enter the user name and the application will display the input user image and information and all his repos sorted according to the stars of it, if there is any network error the app will display an image of the error,
if the user name was found but he doesn't have any repos the app will show a gif of the statue.

## 📍 Live Link

we have a live [link](https://ca-g12.github.io/API-Project-Agha-AliShanti/) but not the all features work because of our app depends on github api and when we push the code the repo the token key will revoked automatically
if you want to learn more this issue see this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/token-expiration-and-revocation#token-revoked-when-pushed-to-a-public-repository-or-public-gist)
